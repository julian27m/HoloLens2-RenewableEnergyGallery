Currently, one of the biggest problems in society is the way in which information is taught. Education in general has been following the same structure for many years, where students are limited to listening and picking up short messages on specific topics.

In order to find innovative solutions to these problems, I am doing a research on how the different types of education may impact students in Bogotá, Colombia.
It has been decided to direct this project to visual and interactive learning in order to generate a greater impact within those involved. First, dynamic experiences will be designed to encourage active learning. As Bransford, J. D., Brown, A. L. and Cocking, R. R. (2002) state, it has been shown that having this type of practice increases the degree of metacognition of each student, since it generates new scenarios and events in their minds. 
At this point, the term metacognition must be highlighted due to its importance in the pedagogical framework. For me, it is essential that the information to be taught causes an impact on individuals and goes beyond a fleeting appreciation. 

Following the thread, it seems appropriate to include the contributions of the PhD in pedagogy, Montserrat Tesouro, who shows in one of her most famous articles the importance of metacognition. In the text, the Doctor states that developing metacognitive processes in students means teaching them to think and to capture their own ideas based on previous approaches. 

## Why to use augmented reality?
Augmented reality offers interactive scenarios, which can represent a new experience to most users. Under this premise, there are two fundamental things. First of all, the interactive experience it offers helps generate stimuli inside the minds of the users, so they can learn in different ways in an active way, which promotes long-term learning and increases the retention of information. Second, a great advantage of using augmented reality in our specific context, university students in Colombia, is that most students have not had contact with this type of technology. This makes people feel motivated to carry out the activity, achieving a better predisposition to learn new concepts.
